<br><br><a>Educational psychology is a dynamic discipline with immense potential applications. 
It includes study of subjects such as theories of learning and motivation,
 span of life development, cognitive science, neurobiology, linguistics, psychosocial studies, and moral development. Much of the research in this field
 is designed to address the desire of teachers to improve their skills, methods, and testing. In a broader sense, anyone that provides guidance, instruction,
 mentoring, and example to another is considered an educator. The information gained from this discipline is of value to parents, social workers, ministers, health 
care workers, organizational trainers, coaches, and persons seeking self improvement.
<br><br>Ultimately, the goal of those working in the field of educational psychology is to understand the processes and conditions under<br>
 which human beings, both in childhood and throughout their lifespan, learn to become mature human beings who fulfill their individual potential,<br>
 live in service to their community, and exercise loving stewardship over the environment.

<br><br><h1>History</h1>

<br><br><h2>William James</h2>
Educational psychology does not claim priority in the systematic analysis of educational processes. Philosophers of education such as Democritus, Quintilian, Vives, and Comenius, had examined, classified, and judged the methods of education centuries before the beginnings of psychology in the late 1800s. Instead, aspirations of the new discipline rested on the application of the scientific methods of observation and experimentation to educational questions.

Even in the earliest years of the discipline, educational psychologists recognized the limitations of this new approach. In his famous series of lectures Talks to Teachers on Psychology, published in 1899 and now regarded as the first educational psychology textbook, the pioneering American psychologist William James commented that:</a>
<br><br>Psychology is a science, and teaching is an art; and sciences never generate arts directly out of themselves. An intermediate inventive mind must make that application, by using its originality.[1]

In a century of research since James, psychologists have offered a variety of applications of their science to the art of teaching. The following persons were selected and featured in a biographical history of educational psychology[2] as having made significant contributions to the field, although many did not regard themselves primarily as educational psychologists:
<br>
Albert Bandura 1925-
Alfred Binet 1857-1911
Benjamin Bloom 1913-1999
Ann Brown 1943-1999
Jerome Bruner 1915-
Lee Cronbach 1916-2001
John Dewey 1859-1952
Nathaniel Gage 1917-
Robert Gagné 1916-2002
William James 1842-1910
Maria Montessori 1870-1952
Jean Piaget 1896-1980
Herbert Simon 1916–2001
Burrhus Frederic Skinner 1904-1990
Charles Spearman 1863-1945
Lewis Terman 1877-1956
Edward L. Thorndike 1874-1949
Lev Semenovich Vygotsky 1896-1934
Edward L. Thorndike developed the theory of instrumental conditioning and, in so doing, created the foundation of educational pedagogy. His method emphasized use of repetition, use of rewards and punishments, and the use of time period breaks between teaching similar subjects. Though Thorndike's (1912) theory has not been popular since the 1960s in the United States, his thought presaged later work on programmed instruction, mastery learning, and computer based learning:

If, by a miracle of mechanical ingenuity, a book could be so arranged that only to him who had done what was directed on page one would page two become visible, and so on, much that now requires personal instruction could be managed by print.[3]

Thorndike's view was similar to B. F. Skinner's operant conditioning theory. Common assumptions included the similarities between human beings and animals regarding learning from stimulus and response mechanisms, and the notion that a newborn infant arrives into life with a "blank slate." Their behavioristic ideas formed the generally accepted foundation of the educational science field for fifty years.

Jumping forward several decades, Jean Piaget's theory of cognitive development gained popularity in the 1960s and early 1970s. Piaget rejected the two proposed explanations of the origins of knowledge: empiricism and nativism, creating a third alternative, which came to be known as "constructivism." The Russian psychologist, Lev Vygotsky, also developed a constructivist approach to learning, although he attributed greater importance to social interactions than Piaget. His work became available to the English-speaking world in 1962. His theory of education gained popularity in the late 1960s and early 1970s.


Information processing theory was initiated in the 1960s but really came into popularity in the U.S. in the 1980s. This theory explains learning as the "encoding" of "chunks" of information into short term and long term memory, utilizing icons or mental pictures.

Connectionist theory was derived, in part, from information processing theory. Learning, in this theory, is based on patterns of connections between inhibitory and exhibitory activations between brain nodes. Ironically, this theory shares much in common in practice with Thorndike's theory in its emphasis on repetition and feedback.

Neuropsychology developed in a similar time frame as connectionist theory, gaining in acceptance through the 1990s into the twenty-first century. It is concerned with the physiological aspects of the cellular and chemical structure of the brain (the location of the inhibiting and exhibiting activities).

<br><h1>Theories in educational psychology </h1><br>

Two fundamental assumptions that underlie formal educational systems, agreed on by all theorists, are that students (a) retain knowledge and skills they acquire in school, and (b) can apply them in situations outside the classroom. There is considerable evidence that the first assumption is valid. Even when students report not using the knowledge acquired in school, a considerable portion is retained for many years, and long term retention is dependent on the initial level of mastery.[4] [5] There is less consensus on the crucial question of how much knowledge acquired in school transfers to tasks encountered outside formal educational settings. Some argue that evidence for this type of "far transfer" is scarce,[6] [7] while others claim there is abundant evidence of far transfer in specific domains.[8] Such variation was
